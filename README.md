Source files for an android application, working on 1200x1920 device behind a two way mirror panel


Recently I was given an amazing gift, a "magic mirror". It was made for me, and consits of a two way mirror with a cheap android tablet set in the frame behind it. The person who gave it to me had already installed some standard app onto it, showing me the time and weather for my area, but I wanted a little more customisation. Hence, I created this small application. It is rather primitive as of now however I may expand it to be more customisable later.

Look out for updates!
